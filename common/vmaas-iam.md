# Managing IAM access for {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}
{: #vmaas-iam}

Access to {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service-full}} instances for users in your account is controlled by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM). Every user that accesses the {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas-full}} in your account must be assigned an access policy with an IAM role. Review the following roles, actions, and more to help determine the best way to assign access to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}.
{: shortdesc}

The access policy that you assign users in your account determines the actions that a user can complete within the context of the service or specific instance that you select. The allowable actions are customized and defined by {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} as operations that are allowed to on the service. Each action is mapped to an IAM platform or service role that you can assign to a user.

If a specific role and its actions don't fit the use case that you're looking to address, you can [create a custom role](/docs/account?topic=account-custom-roles&interface=ui) and pick the actions to include.
{: tip}

IAM access policies enable access to be granted at different levels. Some of the options include the following accesses:

* Access across all instances of the service in your account
* Access to an individual service instance in your account
* Access to a specific resource within an instance

Review the following tables that outline what types of tasks each role allows for when you're working with {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}. Platform management roles enable users to complete tasks on service resources at the platform level. For example, assign user access to the service, create, delete or scale instances, and bind instances to applications. Service access roles enable users to access {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}. For more information about the exact actions that are mapped to each role, see [IAM roles and actions](/docs/account?topic=account-iam-service-roles-actions).

## Assigning access to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} in the console
{: #assign-access-console}
{: ui}

You can assign access in the console in one of the following ways:

* Access policies per user. You can manage access policies per user from the **Manage** > **Access (IAM)** > **Users** page in the console. For more information about the steps to assign IAM access, see [Managing access to resources](/docs/account?topic=account-assign-access-resources&interface=ui).
* Access groups. Access groups are used to streamline access management by assigning access to a group once. Then, you can add or remove users as needed from the group to control their access. You manage access groups and their access from the **Manage** > **Access (IAM)** > **Access groups** page in the console. For more information, see [Assigning access to a group in the console](/docs/account?topic=account-groups&interface=ui#access_ag).
