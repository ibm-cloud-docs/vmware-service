# Understanding IBM's Software Currency Policy
{: #policies}

Review the following policies to understand how {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} maintains software currency for VMware® and third party software.

IBM defines a major release as the first update level after a VMware major release (8.0u1, for example) with the following exceptions.
* Third party certifications on a new release. For example, IBM does not certify that Zerto works on VMware ESXi™ 8.0u1.
* IBM code freeze windows.

| VMware vSphere and VMware vCloud Director releases | Target |
|:------- |:---------- |
| Major releases (7.x, for example) | up to 9 months |
| Minor releases (7.1x, for example) | up to 4 months |
| Patches, hotfixes, maintenance packs | up to 45 days |
| Day zero exploits (IBM security policy) | within 5 days |
