# Understanding IBM software currency policy
{: #policies}

Review the following policies to understand how {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} maintains software currency for VMware® by Broadcom and third-party software.

IBM defines a major release as the first update level after a VMware major release (for example, 8.0u1) with the following exceptions:
* Third-party certifications on a new release. For example, IBM does not certify that Zerto works on VMware vSphere ESXi™ 8.0u1.
* IBM code freeze windows.

| Minor releases (for example, 7.1.x) | Up to 4 months |
| Patches, hotfixes, and maintenance packs | Up to 45 days |
| Day zero uses (IBM security policy) | Within 5 days |
