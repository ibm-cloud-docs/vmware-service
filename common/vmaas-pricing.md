# {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} pricing
{: #vmaas_pricing}

{{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_full}} compute resources are available as either a single-tenant or multitenant model.

The {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas-full}} single-tenant model offers dedicated hosts that are managed by your organization. First, you order a {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} single-tenant Cloud Director site then you create one or more virtual data centers (VDCs) where you deploy your virtual machines (VMs).

For the multitenant model, {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} hosts and operates a resource pool where you order virtual resources as needed. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} manages your capacity, performance, and hardware upgrades. When you order a multitenant instance, you select the location to create a VDC in an existing Cloud Director site.

On the **{{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}}** order page, click [See pricing details](/vmware/vmware_as_a_service/provision/vdc_st) to view the rate card that outlines cost details by feature.

## Understanding billing terminology
{: #vmaas_pricing-term}

### Usage
{: #vmaas_pricing-term-usage}

Metering determines how {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} counts usage for the full potential size of the resource for the time period that the resource is used.

For example, a single-zone on-demand VDC is created with a resource limit of 100 virtual CPU (vCPU) and 800 GB RAM. The data center has no VMs running on it, so you do not receive a charge for the vCPU and RAM. If an 8 vCPU with 8 GB virtual machine (VM) is started, metering is calculated for the size of that VM. If the VM uses fewer resources than the ones assigned to it, metering is applicable to the full size of the VM.

### Allocation
{: #vmaas_pricing-term-alloc}

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} bills based on the resources that you allocate when you provision an instance. The allocated resources are guaranteed.

Metering is applicable to the full potential size of the resource for the life of the resource.

For example, a single-zone reserved VDC is created with a resource allocation of 100 vCPU and 800 GB RAM and no VMs are created or running on it. Metering is applicable to 100 vCPU and 800 GB RAM.

### Peak metric usage
{: #vmaas_pricing-term-metric}

The metric displays on your bill as either monthly peak metric usage or hourly peak metric usage.

*Monthly peak usage* is the maximum value of the metric that is used over a full month. For example, a single-zone reserved VDC is created with 100 vCPU and 800 GB RAM. Later in the month, the data center is reduced to 50 vCPU and 400 GB RAM. The monthly peak usage is 100 vCPU and 800 GB RAM.

*Hourly peak usage* is the maximum value of the metric that is used over an hour. For example, if 100 vCPU is used for a minute of the hour with 0 vCPU used for the other 59 mins, the hourly peak metric usage is 100 vCPU.

View service billing and usage details in the VMware Solutions console. Click **Manage > Billing and usage** to review the service usage and charges. In the **Billing and usage** view, locate the **VMware Cloud Foundation as a Service** service type. Then, locate the **Organization** plan to find the service usage across all VDCs in that organization. For multitenant models, VDC usage is located in a separate plan for either the on-demand or the reserved pricing plan.

## Billing considerations for single-tenant models
{: #vmaas_pricing-single} 

Review minimum order requirements and storage considerations for single-tenant models.

Minimum 2 servers (minimum 7 servers for vSANâ„¢ profiles)
 * 2 hosts (2-socket 32 cores, 192 GB RAM)
 * 24 TB of shared storage
 * Minimum of 1 VDC with a Medium Dedicated Edge

With a seven host minimum with vSAN profiles, a high availability standard with FTT=2 and RAID6 ensures that a system can tolerate multiple failures during a maintenance event with no data loss. Consider the overhead that you must incorporate when you determine the amount of storage to provision.

Storage that is ordered after the first day of the month is prorated for the first month. Storage that is removed during the month is charged for the full month that it is removed. Each storage change is treated individually. For example, when you remove storage then add storage, the bill reflects both storages for that month. For vSAN host profiles, the profile name displays the total of both raw and the usable storage.

| Feature | Billing model |
|:--------|:--------------|
| Host profiles | Size for bare metal server profiles including sockets, core, and RAM. \n - Hosts are billed monthly. \n - Hosts that you order after the first day of the month are prorated for the first month. \n - Hosts that are removed during the month are charged for the full month that they are removed. \n - Each host is treated individually. For example, when you remove a host then add a host, the bill reflects two hosts for that month. |

## Billing considerations for multitenant models
{: #vmaas_pricing-multi}

{{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}} offers two pricing plans for creating multitenant VDCs: **On-demand** and **Reserved**. 
 
For on-demand instances, virtual data center vCPU and RAM are allocated as needed. Pricing is hourly based on the resource usage in the VDC. The amount of time that the allocation takes depends on global usage of the virtual data center vCPU and RAM. Set the maximum value limits for vCPU and RAM.

For reserved instances, the vCPU and RAM VDC reservations are pre-allocated and their availability is guaranteed. Pricing is monthly based on the allocation size of the VDC.

For both on-demand and reserved plans, you can increase and decrease the vCPU and RAM resources on a VDC later as required.

Storage quantity includes all storage that is allocated per VM, even if the VM is stopped, and all VM snapshots. Storage usage increases with new VMs and snapshots and decreases when VMs and snapshots are removed.

Storage policy availability can vary by region and deployment topology.

| Feature | Metrics | Billing model |
|:--------|:-------|:--------------|
| **On-demand** vCPU | TOTAL_VCPU_HOURS | The peak vCPU **usage** over the period of an hour. \n - vCPU is billed hourly. \n -  vCPU quantity is for all vCPU allocated to all running VMs in the VDC at any time per hour. \n - When a VM is stopped it is not counted in the total vCPU calculation. For example, if two running VMs both have 4 vCPU, then a third VM is started at 4 vCPU. The vCPU for the one hour period is 12 vCPU. |
| **On-demand** RAM | TOTAL_RAM_GB_HOURS | The peak memory **usage** over the period of an hour. \b - RAM is billed hourly. \n - RAM quantity is for all RAM allocated to all running VMs in the VDC at any time per hour. \n -  When a VM is stopped it is not counted in the total RAM calculation. For example, if two running VMs have 16 GB RAM, then a third VM is started also at 16 GB RAM. The RAM for the one hour period is 48 GB. |
| Multizone **On-demand** vCPU | | - vCPU is billed hourly. \n - vCPU quantity supports vCPU in both (2) of the data centers for all vCPU allocated to all running VMs in the VDC at any time per hour. \n - The vCPU size is double the cost of your order to support the vCPU in both data centers. For example, if the VM has 4 vCPU and runs in a multizone region, then the total vCPU is 8. \n - You can see the amount of vCPU that the VM uses in the primary region and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} allocates the same amount of vCPU in the secondary region. |
| Multizone **On-demand** RAM | | - RAM is billed hourly.  \n - RAM quantity supports RAM in both (2) of the data centers for all RAM allocated to all running VMs in the VDC at any time per hour. \n - The RAM size is double the cost of your order to support the RAM in both data centers. For example, if the VM has 16 GB RAM in a multizone region, then the total is 32 GB RAM. \n - You can see the amount of RAM that the VM uses in the primary region and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} allocates the same amount of RAM in the secondary region. |

| **Reserved** vCPU | MAX_VCPU | The peak vCPU **allocation** for the VDC over the period of one month. The peak vCPU metric is determined by the largest vCPU reservation value that is selected by the customer over a one month period. \n - vCPU is billed monthly for the highest capacity reservation set for that month. \n - VDC reservations are prorated for the first month. If the reservation is increased, then decreased again, the high water mark vCPU capacity reservation is charged for that month. |
| **Reserved** RAM | MAX_RAM_GB | The peak memory **allocation** for the VDC over the period of one month. The peak memory metric is determined by the largest memory reservation value that is selected by the customer over a one month period. \n - RAM is billed monthly for the highest capacity reservation set for that month. \n - VDC reservations are prorated for the first month. If the reservation is increased, then decreased again, the high water mark RAM capacity reservation is charged for that month. |
| Multizone **Reserved** vCPU | | - vCPU is billed monthly for the highest capacity reservation set for that month. \n - The vCPU size is double the cost of your reservation to support the vCPU in both data centers.  For example, if the VM has 4 vCPU reserved in a multizone region, then the total reserved vCPU is 8. \n - You can see the amount of vCPU that the VM uses in the primary region and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} allocates the same amount of vCPU in the secondary region. |
| Multizone **Reserved** RAM | | - RAM is billed monthly for the highest capacity reservation set for that month. \n - The RAM size is double the cost of your reservation to support the RAM in both data centers.  For example, if the VM has 16 GB RAM reserved in a multizone region, then the total reservation is 32 GB RAM. \n - You can see the amount of RAM that the VM uses in the primary region and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} allocates the same amount of RAM in the secondary region. |
