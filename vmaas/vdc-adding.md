# Adding virtual data centers
{: #vdc-adding}

The instance is not used to run VMware workloads directly. VMware virtual data centers (VDCs) are used to deploy and run VMware virtualized networking and to run VMware workloads.Â 

You can deploy one or more VDCs in an instance. The minimum instance configuration consists of 2 hosts (2 Sockets - 32 Cores, and 192 GB RAM). You can order up to 100 efficiency edges or 1 performance edge of medium size until more hosts are added to one of the clusters in the provider VDC.

## Virtual data center name
{: #vdc-adding-vdc-name}

The VDC name is set to **vdc-_xx_** by default, where _xx_ represents two randomly generated alphabetic characters.

You can also specify a VDC name that meets the following requirements:
* The maximum length is 128 characters.
* Only alphanumeric, dash (-), and underscore (_) characters are allowed.
* The name must be unique within all active VDCs in your account. You can create a VDC that has the same name as a previously deleted VDC.

## Procedure to add virtual data centers
{: #vdc-adding-procedure}

1. In the VMware Solutions console, click **Resources > {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}}** from the left navigation pane.
2. In the **{{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}}** table, click an instance name.
3. Click the **Infrastructure** tab. In the instance has multiple provider VDCs (PVDCs), ensure that the appropriate PVDC tab is selected.
4. Click the **Data centers** tab and click **Add new**.
5. On the **Virtual data center** page, specify the VDC name, the resource group, and the site and PVDC names. The site and PVDC names are preset based on the instance settings, but you can change them.
6. Under **Network edge**, specify the edge type, either **Efficiency** or **Performance**. Edge storage costs might occur for either option.

   | Edge type | Details |
   |:--------- |:------- |
   | Efficiency | These edges allocate networking resources that can be used by up to 100 VDCs before another efficiency edge needs to be created. The first time an efficiency edge is selected new CPU, RAM, and storage resources are required. CPU and RAM are used from the single tenant site. New edge storage is allocated at a cost. Subsequent VDCs up to 100 can use this edge at no extra cost. |
   | Performance | These edges allocate new networking resources that are attached to the single VDC. New CPU, RAM, and storage resources are required. CPU and RAM are used from the single tenant site. New edge storage is allocated at a cost. |

7. For the **Performance** edge type, specify the edge size, **Medium**, **Large**, or **Extra Large**.
8. After all configurations are set, review the cost, and click **Create** to submit the VDC order.

## Results after you add virtual data centers
{: #vdc-adding-results}

* The deployment of the resources starts automatically and you receive confirmation that the order is being processed. You can check the deployment status, including any issues that might require your attention, by viewing the VDC status.
* When all resources are successfully deployed, the ordered components are installed on your virtual platform.
* When the resources are ready to use, the status is changed to **Running**.

## What to do next
{: #vdc-adding-next}

1. [View the virtual data center](/docs/vmware-service?topic=vmware-service-vdc-view-delete#vdc-view-delete-details) that you ordered.
2. [Set the admin password](/docs/vmware-service?topic=vmware-service-accessing-vcd-console#accessing-vcd-console-reset-proc) for the VMware Cloud Director console.
