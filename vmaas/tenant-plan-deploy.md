# Planning the deployment

Before you order an instance, ensure that you plan your deployment.

## VMware deployment size

VMware deployments are sized based on the CPU, memory, and storage that are required to run the targeted workload. If you are planning a workload migration from on-premises to the cloud, the on-premises size is a good starting point. VMware deployments are elastic and you can resize them at any time.
