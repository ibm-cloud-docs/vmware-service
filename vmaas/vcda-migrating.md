# Migrating workloads to {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}}
{: #vcda-migrating}

Use VMware Cloud Director Availability (VCDA) to migrate your vCenter virtual machine (VM) workloads from on-premises and VMware vCenter ServerÂ® environments to {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_full}}.

## Before you begin
{: #vcda-migrating-prereq}

Complete the following prerequisites before you migrate your VM workload.

### Install VCDA on-premises in VMware vCenter Server
{: #vcda-migrating-prereq-vmaas-onprem}

Before you configure public or private endpoints, you must install VCDA on-premises in VMware vCenter Server.

The following steps outline a validated process. Many different configurations work.
{: note}

1. From VMware Customer Connect, download the **VMware Cloud Director Availability On-premises Appliance** ``.ova`` file and upload it to your jump server. Ensure that you download the ``.ovf`` file.
2. Log in to VMware vCenter Server and navigate to the cluster name.
3. Right-click the cluster name and click **Deploy OVF Template...**.
4. From the **Deploy OVF Template** window, complete the following configurations. After you complete the configuration for each tab, click **NEXT** to move to the next tab.

## Procedure to migrate workloads to {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}}
{: #vcda-migrating-procedure}

After you enable your public or private connection, migrate your VM to {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}}.

Ensure that the VM is powered on from vCenter Server.
{: important}

1. From the VMware console, click the **More** drop-down menu to select the VMware Cloud Director Availability instance to migrate.
2. From the VMware Cloud Director Availability console, click **Incoming Replications**.
3. Click **ALL ACTIONS > New migration**.
4. Select the following options in the **New Incoming Migration** window.
   * For **Source VMs**, select the VM to migrate from the **Source site** drop-down and click **NEXT**.
   * For **Destination VDC and Storage policy**, select the target VDC to migrate the VM to and click **NEXT**.
   * For **Settings**, keep the default options and click **NEXT**.
   * For **Ready to complete**, review the settings and click **FINISH**.

   The source VM is configured and then synchronized to the Cloud Director site.

5. Scroll to the bottom of the **vApp/VM** column to locate the replicated VM. The replication is complete when the **Last changed** column moves from *Synchronizing* to the date and time of the replication.
6. When the replication is complete, ensure that the newly replicated VM is selected and click **ALL ACTIONS > Migrate** to begin the migration.
7. Select the following options from the **Migrate** window.
   * For **Migrate Settings**, keep the default options and click **NEXT**.
   * For **Ready to complete**, review the settings and click **FINISH**.

   The VMware Cloud Director Availability service copies the runtime data from the source VM to the destination VM. When the replication is complete, the migrated VM powers on in the Cloud Director site and powers off in the vCenter Server instance. The migration is complete when the **Last changed** column moves from *Migrate* to the date and time of the migration.

8. Click the destination virtual data center name to verify the migration. Click **Compute > Virtual Machines** to view the VM. The migration is successful if the VM is powered on.

### Known issues and workarounds
{: #vcda-migrating-procedure-issues}

From the **Incoming replications** table, the migrated VM doesnât start synchronizing and synchronization stays at 0%.

1. Log in to the on-premises VMware Cloud Director Availability console.
2. Click **Settings** and expand **Network**. Click **Static routes**.
3. Click **ADD** to add a new static route. For the destination and gateway, use the primary subnet for the hosts and virtual server instances for your vCenter Server instance.
4. Click **APPLY** and the VM synchronizes.
