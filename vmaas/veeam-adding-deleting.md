# Adding and deleting Veeam Backup

{{site.data.content.vms-deprecated-note}}

You can add the VeeamÂ® Backup service to your Cloud Director site instance if you did not include it in your instance order. You can delete the Veeam service from your instance if you no longer need the backup service.

For multitenant instances, you must install the Veeam service after you provision your virtual data center (VDC).
{: requirement}

Before you delete the Veeam Backup service from your instance, review the following considerations.

* Block storage backups are permanently deleted.
* {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Object Storage offload storage backups are maintained for seven days after the service removal, and then is permanently deleted.
* You have seven days after the Veeam service is deleted to open a support ticket to restore backups. For more information, see [Contacting IBM Support](/docs/vmware-service?topic=vmware-service-support).
* The Veeam base, hosts, and license charges continue until the end of month.
* Storage charges stop as the storage areas are permanently deleted.
