# Adding and deleting storage
{: #storage-adding-deleting}

You can increase or decrease the NFS storage capacity of your deployment by adding or deleting storage to and from an instance.

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}} console, click **Resources > {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}}** from the left navigation pane.
2. In the **{{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}}** table, click an instance name.
3. Click the **Infrastructure** tab and click **Edit > NFS storage**.
4. On the **Edit shared storage** window, increase or decrease the current sizings for the performance tiers available.
5. Review the new cost, select the confirmation checkbox, and click **Change** to confirm.

Editing the storage details might take up to 24 hours to complete. If a storage update is in progress, you cannot edit the storage until the previous operation is complete.
