# Ordering virtual data centers for {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}} multitenant
{: #vdc-adding-mt}

With {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_full}}, you can quickly provision a complete VMware virtual data center environment and control the capacity that is used to run VMwareÂ® workloads. With VMware as a Service multi-tenant, you start by creating the multi-tenant virtual data center.
Note that a {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}} multitenant site is created automaticlly when the first multitenant VDC is created in a region.  All  multitenant virtual datacenrters created in a region are associated with the same automatically created site.  User access to the multi-tenant VDCs within the cloud account are controled through IAM policies against the site.

For multitenant instances, the minimum instance configuration consists of one vCPU and 1 GB RAM.

## Virtual data center name
{: #vdc-adding-vdc-name-mt}

The VDC name is set to **vdc-_xx_** by default, where _xx_ represents two randomly generated alphabetic characters.

You can also specify a VDC name that meets the following requirements:
* The maximum length is 128 characters.
* Only alphanumeric, dash (-), and underscore (_) characters are allowed.
* The name must be unique within all active VDCs in your account. You can create a VDC that has the same name as a previously deleted VDC.

## Procedure to order {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}} multitenant virtual data centers
{: #vdc-adding-procedure-mt}

1. In the VMware Solutions console, click **Create** on the **{{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}}** card.
2. On the **{{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}}** page, select the **VMwaaS multitenant Virtual data center** card.
3. Specify the VDC name and select the resource group.
4. Select the pricing plan according to your consumption needs.
5. Select the regional location and Cloud Director site and then select a provider virtual data center (PVDC) which will map to one or more data centers. The site and PVDC names are filtered based on the location setting.
6. Optionally toggle fast provisioning of virtual machines (VMs) on.
7. Review your options to order a network edge.
   * To order a network edge, ensure that the toggle for **Create without network edge** is off and specify the edge type. Edge storage costs might occur.
   * Toggle **Create without network edge** on. This option is suitable for centralized networking administration and control over multiple VDCs.
8. Select resource allocations according to your pricing plan.
   * For on-demand, optionally enable consumption limits. Then, select the vCPU and RAM limits. Toggle the consumption limit option off if you do not want to set limits.  Limits define the celling on maximum ammout of vCPU and RAM that can be used by the multitenant VDC.
   * For reserved, select the vCPU and RAM capacity reservation for the VDC.  The CPU and RAM are reserved for exclusive use by the created virtual datacenter and are metereed monthly for the full reservatiuon.
9. Review the cost, accept the terms, and click **Create** to submit the VDC order.

For multitenant instances, install the Veeam service after you provision your virtual data center (VDC). For more information, see [Adding and deleting Veeam Backup and Replication](/docs/vmware-service?topic=vmware-service-veeam-adding-deleting).
{: note}

## Results after you create virtual data centers
{: #vdc-adding-results-mt}

* The deployment of the resources starts automatically and you receive confirmation that the order is being processed. You can check the deployment status, including any issues that might require your attention, by viewing the VDC status.
* When all resources are successfully deployed, the ordered components are installed on your virtual platform.
* When the resources are ready to use, the status of the VDC is changed to **Available**.
