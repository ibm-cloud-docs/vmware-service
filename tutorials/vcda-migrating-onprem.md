## Migrate VMware vCenter workloads to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}
{: #vcda-migrating-onprem-migrate}
{: step}

After you enable your public or private connection, migrate your VM to {{site.data.keyword.vcf-aas}}.

Ensure that the VM is powered on from vCenter Server.
{: important}

1. From the VMware console, click the **More** drop-down menu to select the VCDA instance to migrate.
2. From the VCDA console, click **Incoming Replications**.
3. Click **ALL ACTIONS > New migration**.
4. Select the following options in the **New Incoming Migration** window.
   * For **Source VMs**, select the VM to migrate from the **Source site** drop-down and click **NEXT**.
   * For **Destination VDC and Storage policy**, select the target VDC to migrate the VM to and click **NEXT**.
   * For **Settings**, keep the default options and click **NEXT**.
   * For **Ready to complete**, review the settings and click **FINISH**.

   The source VM is configured and then synchronized to the Cloud Director site. The replication is complete when the **Last changed** column moves from *Synchronizing* to the date and time of the replication.

5. When the replication is complete, ensure that the newly replicated VM is selected and click **ALL ACTIONS > Migrate** to begin the migration.
6. Select the following options from the **Migrate** window.
   * For **Migrate Settings**, keep the default options and click **NEXT**.
   * For **Ready to complete**, review the settings and click **FINISH**.

   The VCDA service copies the runtime data from the source VM to the destination VM. When the replication is complete, the migrated VM powers on in the Cloud Director site and powers off in the vCenter Server instance. The migration is complete when the **Recovery state** column moves from *Not started* to *Failed-Over*.

7. Click the destination virtual data center name to verify the migration. Click **Compute > Virtual Machines** to view the VM.
8. After the migration is complete, delete the failed-over migration. Click **ALL ACTIONS > Delete replication**.

The migration metadata is deleted. Deleting the replication does not delete the source or the destination VMs.
{: note}

## Known issues and workarounds
{: #vcda-migrating-onprem-issues}

From the **Incoming replications** table, the migrated VM doesnât start synchronizing and synchronization stays at 0%.

The VCDA appliance cannot reach the ESXi hosts. If no VMkernel adapter has the âvSphere Replicationâ and âvSphere Replication NFCâ assigned services, VCDA uses the Management VMkernel adapter. For the VMkernal adapter that is used, VCDA must reach this IP address on the ESXi host for replication.

To resolve, add static routes on the VCDA appliance.

1. Log in to the on-premises VCDA console.
2. Click **Settings** and expand **Network**. Click **Static routes**.
3. Click **ADD** to add a new static route. For the destination and gateway, use the primary subnet for the hosts and virtual server instances for your vCenter Server instance.
4. Click **APPLY** and the VM synchronizes.
